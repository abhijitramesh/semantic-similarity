# Semantic Similarity

This repository would contain implementation of semantic similarity with different state of the art transformers from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)

## Introduction

Semantic similarity is used to measure the distance or similarity between two pair of words, phrases, sentences or documents. This can be done in two ways knowledge-based or corpus-based. Here we would be doing a corpus-bases approach. This implementation is inspired from semantic similarity implementation with BERT example from [keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/semantic_similarity_with_bert/). The idea here is to change the models and see if we could get a better performance with other transformer architecture like t5.
